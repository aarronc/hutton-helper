## Installing the Addon

Please grab your preferred version from the [Downloads Page](https://hot.forthemug.com/download/) and install doing the following

`Note : If your familiar with EDMC this plugin is installed the same way as any other plugin`

If you have not installed EDMC or a plugin before, this will help you get started :-

1. Download a program called Elite Dangerous Market Connector (EDMC) from [here](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/releases/) (This is what our plugin uses to work)
1. Install the program you just downloaded.
1. Open the program. (You may need to go to `C:\Program Files (x86)\EDMarketConnector` and open it from there. Sometimes it does not add a shortcut to your desktop)
1. Once open go to `File > Settings`
1. Look for the plugins tab on the window that has just popped up, its the last one on the right. Click on the tab and then on the open button.
1. Create a folder in the directory that has opened up and call it HuttonHelper
1. Download Full Version OR the Lite version of the Hutton Helper and open the .zip file ONLY 1 Version, you do not need both (In it you will see a lot of files that end in .py)
1. Extract the files into the HuttonHelper folder you made in step 6 You can normally highlight all of the files and drag them into the folder or use the extract button
